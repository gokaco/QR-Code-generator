This repo contains the Annotated and unannotated version of nayuki/QR-Code-generator

Annotated version is on branch case_study, Unannotated version is on master.

It is better to compile files indivisually as there are errors in files.

Commands-

```
cd QR-Code-generator/java/src/main/java
javac -processor signedness io/nayuki/qrcodegen/"Filename".java
```

In this case study I learnt that signedness checker is weak in some classes and needs enhancements such as:-

1.)Non equality comparisons of unsigned values
2.)Scanner.java(Annotation needed in theJDK)


When you will run the test file using signedness checker you will get many errors(I have not wriiten some in the doumnetation as there are many) of-

1.)Non equality comparisons of unsigned values
